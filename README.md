This is a weather app that displays the weather for 4 locations simultaneously with the ability to change those locations. Your set locations are stored in localStorage so that way you don't have to enter your locations each time you enter the app. This app was built with a React front end with a Node backend while utilizing RapidApi's Weather API.

6. Navigate to localhost:3000 in your browser
